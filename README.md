# Solidity Security Lab

Hands-on smart contract security lab focused on breaking, exploiting, and hardening Solidity systems.

## Objectives
- Master Solidity from a security perspective
- Reproduce common smart contract vulnerabilities
- Develop exploit proofs-of-concept
- Practice secure contract design

## Structure
- contracts/ → Solidity contracts (secure & vulnerable)
- exploits/ → Attack contracts & PoCs
- notes/ → Security analysis and learning documentation
